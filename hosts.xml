		This specification uses a regular expression for host name matching.
		See <http://wpkg.org/index.php/Regular_expression_support> for more
		details.
		This will match any non-empty hostname and assign it the "other"
		profile. So the entry acts as a kind of "catch all" entry. All hosts
		which are not matched by a more-specific host entry appearing before
		this one will be assigned the "other" profile.
		Note: In case you enabled the applyMultiple option in config.xml this
		will assign the "other" profile to all hosts in addition to any more-
		precise host specification applying before.
