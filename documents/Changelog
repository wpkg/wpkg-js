= CHANGES FOR 1.3 release
===============================================================================
Changes 2011-12-08, v1.3.0 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Final release of WPKG 1.2.1-RC49 as WPKG 1.3.0. No further code changes.

Changes 2011-11-23, v1.2.1-RC49 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed minor typo in error message about invalid XML structure loaded.

Changes 2011-11-23, v1.2.1-RC48 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed invalid regular expression in host matching (within hosts.xml) would
     exit WPKG. Now a warning about invalid expression is printed.
FIX: Fixed lost host information in settings (wpkg.xml) due to applied XML
     transforms. Bug was introduced in transforms processing added due to
     request in bug 257. Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting.
NEW: Using correct name space in settings (wpkg.xml) written locally.
NEW: Added proper processing information to settings (wpkg.xml).

Changes 2011-11-21, v1.2.1-RC47 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Re-implemented XSL transforms when reading XML files. This allows some
     more "special" XML definitions which include content from other files or
     the use of XML "templating".
     The implementation might require some more through testing to verify it
     does not breask any existing package definitions. Especially when using
     mixed package definition, some using namespaces and others who don't use.
     Fixes bug 257. Thanks to Falko Trojahn.

Changes 2011-11-18, v1.2.1-RC46 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
MOD: Added checkHost type to wpkg.xsd to allow strict verification of host type
     checks.
NEW: Added variable expansion to advanced host match attributes (variable
     expansion already worked for "host" type checks).
     Also WPKG now loads profile and host variables before advanced host
     matching is applied. So host and profile variables can be used within
     check expressions.
     Fixes bug 255. Thanks to Ross Newton.

Changes 2011-10-31, v1.2.1-RC45 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
MOD: Not saving changes to settings (wpkg.xml) in remote query mode. Changes to
     the settings database might occur if checks are not stored within the
     given settings database and therefore checks are executed locally on
     remote node. WPKG will not store the results of such local evaluation in
     the settings file now.

Changes 2011-10-30, v1.2.1-RC44 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: If previously executed check results cannot be found in wpkg.xml then
     WPKG will still evaluate the check on local machine if in remote query
     mode. This will work for "host" type checks but not for others like
     registry, file, execute etc. The results in this case might be inaccurate
     and not reflecting the real check evaluation on client side.
     An error will be printed to the logs in this case.
     Fixes bug 252. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.
FIX: Do not try to look up logical checks in previously executed checks in
     wpkg.xml.
     Fixes bug 252.

Changes 2011-10-30, v1.2.1-RC43 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed issue when a check is executed twice during the same WPKG run when
     replacing check result in settings (wpkg.xml).
     Fixes bug 252. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.
MOD: Optimized writing of settings (wpkg.xml). Avoiding unneeded sorting if
     just check nodes are added.

Changes 2011-10-30, v1.2.1-RC42 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Added storing results of executed checks in local settings database.
     This allows to fetch the results from wpkg.xml in remote query mode.
     As a result WPKG will be able to evaluate conditions in remote query mode
     in the same way as the local node would. For example conditions in hosts
     or profiles checking for file or registry keys will be evaluated the same
     way as it evaluated on last run on the client.
     Of course remote query cannot take changes on the client into account
     which happened after last WPKG run.
     Additional change related to bug 252.

Changes 2011-10-29, v1.2.1-RC41 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed id of default Firefox package included in packages/firefox.xml. The
     Profile was referring to "firefox" while the package was called "Firefox".
     As WPKG by default is case-sensitive it did not match. So the "id" has
     been changed to "firefox" now.
FIX: Removed unused variable from the code.
     Fixes bug 253. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.
MOD: Added XML schema for validation to included sample packages and templates.
     Fixes bug 251. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.
FIX: Remote query did not take architecture into account as saved within
     the settings database (wpkg.xml).
     Fixes bug 252. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.
     
     NOTE: Remote query will not take into account speial conditions based on
     other checks like file, registry, execute or uninstall. The reason is
     simply that these values are not available on a remote system.
     So WPKG will have to use local values for such checks.
     If you want to use remote query then you should not use such local-based
     checks in conditions in order to avoid getting query results which differ
     from the results on client side.

Changes 2011-10-28, v1.2.1-RC40 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed spelling errors in new packages.xml.
     Fixes bug 250. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.
FIX: Added namespaces for package templates.
     Fixes bug 251. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.

Changes 2011-10-28, v1.2.1-RC40 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Conditional expressions are defined in generic wpkg namespace at
     http://www.wpkg.org/wpkg. Element form default has been set to unqualified
     in order to hide (localize) namespaces. Thus eliminating the requirement
     to specify condition and check nodes with namespace qualifier.
     Fixes bug 249. Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting.
FIX: Within the <command /> node the "include" attribute shall allow any string
     to be used. Not just install/upgrade/downgrade/remove.
     Fixed in XSD.
     Fixes bug 249. Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting.

Changes 2011-10-27, v1.2.1-RC39 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
MOD: Updated included config.xml, hosts.xml, profiles.xml and packages.xml.
     - Added XML namespace and references to XSD.
     - Updated in-line documentation.
     - Upgraded to latest syntax.
     - Reviewed comments and references.
NEW: Added XSD for config.xml.
NEW: Modified generated site content.
NEW: Added XML namespace and reference to XSD in documentation files.
FIX: Fixed WPKG error in case multiple profiles apply to a host.
     Thanks to Jürgen Depicker for reporting.

Changes 2011-10-24, v1.2.1-RC38 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Additional files for Maven-based build.
NEW: Automatic build of Maven site, including XSD documentation references.
     Maven build creates site documentation including project information:
     - Team information
     - Mailing list references
     - Issue tracker reference
     - Project license
     - Source repository references
     - XSD documentation (hosts, profiles, packages)

Changes 2011-10-22, v1.2.1-RC37 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Allowing multiple checks in logical "NOT" check. If multiple checks are
     specified, then the checks are "And-linked" which means that in case any
     of the sub-checks fails, then the result is "true". If all checks succeed,
     then the result is "false".
     Example:
     <check type="logical" condition="not">
       <check type="host" condition="hostname" value="HOSTNAME"/>
       <check type="host" condition="os"       value="5\.0\.\d{4}"/>
     </check>
     The check will be false only if the host is named HOSTNAME and runs OS
     version 5.0.x (Windows 2000).
     If the OS version does not match or the hostname is different, then the
     result is true, no matter which of the checks (or all) fail.
     Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting the inconsistency between
     implementation and XSD.

Changes 2011-10-22, v1.2.1-RC36 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Added files for maven-based build.
MOD: Moved file/directory structure for maven-based build.
NEW: Added xs3p to generate HTML-based documentation from XSD files.

Changes 2011-10-22, v1.2.1-RC35 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Conditional nodes which did not match were not excluding the enclosing
     XML node. Therefore negative evaluation of conditions did not have
     any effect.
     Fixes bug 248. Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting.

Changes 2011-10-22, v1.2.1-RC34 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: If executed in remote query mode WPKG failed if there was no profile
     assigned to the host executing WPKG (the remote host).
     Initialization of debug messages about assigned profiles has been delayed
     and for queries this information is skipped.
     Fixes issue reported by Stefan Pendl. Thank you!

Changes 2011-10-22, v1.2.1-RC33 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: In remote query mode /query:l did show the contents of the remote host as
     read from settings (wpkg.xml).
     Added cache purging in order to read these attributes from the local host
     instead.

Changes 2011-10-22, v1.2.1-RC32 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed use of host attributes read from settings file in remote mode.
     Caching did prevent the values read from settings to become effective.
     Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting.

Changes 2011-10-22, v1.2.1-RC31 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Re-Fixed evaluation of empty variables.
     Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting.

Changes 2011-10-22, v1.2.1-RC30 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Added /queryMode:<local|remote> command line switch and remoteMode
     configuration parameter. This switch is used to create reliable queries
     on expected changes to a host when running WPKG on a remote node.
     For example when you copy wpkg.xml of a client to your server and use
     wpkg.js /query:im /settings:local\wpkg.xml
     just to query the impact of the next synchronization to this client.
     IN this case WPKG needs to know the host attributes like hostname, IP-
     addresses, architecture etc.
     In remote query mode WPKG will read these values from wpkg.xml (if
     available, check that settingsHostInfo parameter in config.xml is
     enabled).
     
     Here's a description of the new parameter as added to config.xml:
          Allows to switch to remote mode where package verification is skipped.
     remote: Disable package checks and assume that packages in settings
             database are still correctly installed. In remote mode also the
             host information is read from the local settings database.
     local:  Default setting. Query verifies package status using all checks.
     Note: Query mode can only be used with the query switch. It is ignored
     if no /query: command line parameter is used.

     Details: If you intend to copy the local wpkg.xml file to a remote system
     and execute WPKG queries based on this settings database (wpkg.xml) then
     WPKG might print some packages as "required for installation" since the
     package checks fail on the remote host as the package might not be
     installed on the remote host. If remote mode is enabled, then WPKG assumes
     that the packages are properly installed on the executing host without
     actually verifying it.
     Of course it might happen in this case that a package query on the remote
     system says that a package does not need any change but on the real system
     the user might have removed the software meanwhile which will trigger an
     installation if WPKG is run on the client.

     Also note that in remote query mode WPKG will read all host attributes
     from the settings file (wpkg.xml) if these attributes are available. This
     includes hostname, architecture, OS, IP addresses, domainname, groups,
     LCID of the executing user and LCID of the operating system.
     This is required in order to allow evaluation of all conditional
     attributes in exactly the same way as it will evaluate on the client.


Changes 2011-10-22, v1.2.1-RC29 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
MOD: Improved variable handling. Now variables can overwrite previously defined
     variables even if they are defined recursively.
     For example it is possible to "extend" a previously defined variable in
     hosts with a variable defined in profiles or packages. So the following
     is valid now:
     Hosts:       SOFTWARE=\\host\software-share
                  SETTINGS\\host\settings-share
                  VAR1=test
     Profiles:    SOFTWARE=%SOFTWARE%\subdirectory
                  VAR2=test
     Package:     SOFTWARE=%SOFTWARE%\subdir-of-subdir
NEW: Implemented new query parameters:
         s - List host attributes from settings (wpkg.xml).
         l - List host attributes read from local host.
     The "s" option is mainly implemented for statistical and reporting
     purpose. If the local settings database (settings.xml) is copied to any
     host, then this option allows to query the host information attributes
     stored in wpkg.xml. It's supposed to be used with the /settings:<path>
     option therefore.
     e.g. wpkg.js /settings:\\server\share\wpkg-<HOSTNAME>.xml /query:s
     This will show the host attributes of of <HOSTNAME> as enclosed within the
     XML datastructure.
     The "l" option has been mainly implemented for testing purposes. It can
     be used to debug the host attribute parameters read by WPKG. It will
     always read the host attributes from the host wpkg.js is run on.
FIX: /query:m shall list execute="changed" packages only if there are other
     changes to be performed.
     Fixes bug 246. Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting.
FIX: Fixed formatting errors in help message (/help switch).
     Fixes bug 247. Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting.

Changes 2011-10-21, v1.2.1-RC28 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Added /settings:<path> command-line parameter. It allows to specify an
     alternative path to the settings file on command-line rather than
     specifying setings_file_path and settings_file_name in config.xml.
     Note: /settings:<path> takes precedence over config.xml settings.

     /settings:<path>
     Path to the settings (local WPKG database) file to be used. The path might
     be absolute or relative but including the XML file name. This parameter is
     entirely OPTIONAL and should normally not be specified at all.
     If not specified the settings file will be searched at:
     %SystemRoot%\system32\wpkg.xml
     	e.g. '%SystemRoot%\system32\wpkg-custom.xml'.
             e.g. '\\\\server\share\directory\\[HOSTNAME].xml'.
     If you store the settings file on a share make sure the names is unique!
     You can use environment variables as well as the following expressions:
      [HOSTNAME]  Replaced by the executing hostname.
      [PROFILE]   Replaced by the concatenated list of profiles applied.

	 This feature will potentially ease reporting as settings XML files stored
	 on a share can be queried against the host database using wpkg.js
	 directly. So no duplicated code with external tools is required to
	 determine whether a package is scheduled to be changed.
	 Thanks to Kai Pastor for the hint.

Changes 2011-10-20, v1.2.1-RC27 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
MOD: Changed variable expansion order. Now the order is clearly defined as
     follows:
     - Host variables
     - Profile variables (in reverse order, dependencies first)
     - Package variables
     This way package variables can refer to profile variables.
     Profile variables in turn can refer to host variables.
     Variables can always also include the value of variables already defined
     using the %VARIABLE% syntax in the value attribute of the variable
     definition. So for example a package variable can refer to a profile
     variable. A package variable can also refer to a variable defined within
     the same package as long as the variable it refers to appears before the
     one referring to it.
     Thanks to Brent A Nelson for pointing us to the issue.
     Thanks to Stefan Pendl for analyzing the issue.
MOD: Improved variable reading using caches for host and profile variables.

Changes 2011-10-18, v1.2.1-RC26 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
MOD: Improved downloader.
     Now supports UNC paths in download URL. If UNC path is specified the
     file is copied using robocopy.exe utility which is built-in into newer
     Windows versions (Windows 7). For older Windows Versions (Windows XP) it
     can be downloaded via the resource kit of Windows Server 2003 and placed
     in the downloader tool folder.
     Referring to UNC directories (eg. "\\server\share\folder\" (note the
     trailing slash) will synchronize the whole folder to the target directory.
     Of course MD5/SHA1 verification is only available when copying single
     files but not when synchronizing complete folder structures.
     Extensions inspired by enhancements made by David Petterson.
     Thank you!

Changes 2011-10-16, v1.2.1-RC25 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed setting empty environment varaible value on Windows 2k/XP.
     Thanks to Stefan Pendl for poiting this out. Fixes Bug 243.

Changes 2011-10-16, v1.2.1-RC24 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
MOD: Updated package template for NSIS using _? parameter which works with most
     NSIS installers to prevent installer forking.
     Thanks to Malte Starostik. Further request in Bug 241.
MOD: Further improvement of default user notification strings in config.xml.
     Thanks to Malte Starostik. Further request in Bug 239.

Changes 2011-10-16, v1.2.1-RC23 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
MOD: Modified XSD data structure. Moved common elements to wpkg.xsd in order
     not to duplicate documentation.
FIX: Prevent crash in case of invalid XML wehere a <variable /> node is missing
     either the name or value attribute. WPKG will now print an error to the
     logs and ignore the variable.
     Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting. Fixes bug 243.
FIX: Fixed handling of packages which do not use classic commands but only the
     new commands style using <commands /> node.
     Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting. Fixes bug 244.
NEW: New feature allowing manual package installation to be combined with
     synchronization.
     If a package is installed manually using the /install:<package> command-
     line switch, then the package is added to the local package database and
     retained during future synchronizations.
     In previous versions of WPKG you could have either installed packages via
     profiles or manually but if you installed a package manually then
     subsequent synchronizations would have removed the package if it was not
     part of the profile. This enhancement allows local administrators to
     manually install any package provided in the package database. Packages
     installed manually will also be updated on subsequent synchronizations.
     Let's provide some examples.
     
     Host A has the following packages assigned:
     - Pidgin
     - Thunderbird
     
     A local administrator would like to install Firefox on the machine too.
     Of course as a local admin he could also install Firefox using the Mozilla
     installer but this would mean he has to take care about updates and
     potentially synchronize such update actions with the IT departement.
     Now a local administrator could simply use the "wpkg.js /install:firefox"
     command (of course given the fact that the IT departements maintains a
     package called "firefox") and get the official Firefox package installed.
     
     On future "wpkg.js /synchronize" runs WPKG will update the "firefox"
     package in the same way as if the IT departement would have added
     "firefox" to the profile applied to the host. Therefore on the host as
     defined above WPKG would look for updates on Pidgin, Thunderbird and
     Firefox during synchronization.
     
     
     If the IT departement decides to remove the "firefox" package from the
     server-side package database this likely means that support is dropped and
     Firefox shall not be used any more. In such case WPKG would also remove
     the package manually installed via /install:firefox on synchronization.
     
     So as you see the /install:<package> switch can be used by local
     administrators to kind of modify or extend the server-based profile with
     some manually chosen packages which keep updated automatically when
     synchronizing.

Changes 2011-10-11, v1.2.1-RC22 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>

     Fixes bug 239. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.
FIX: Fixed typos in XSD files.
     Fixes bug 240. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.
FIX: Fixed typos in NSIS package template.

Changes 2011-10-10, v1.2.1-RC21 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Improved handling of recursive command inclusion. Inclusions where the
     loop did not include the root element were not detected properly. For
     example:
     upgrade -> remove -> downgrade -> remove
     This did cause an unhandled infinite loop.
     The new implementation will detect it and ignore the inclusion of remove
     from downgrade (printing an error to the log).
FIX: Fixed download tag. Thanks for Heiko Helmle for reporting and providing
     fix.
NEW: Updated package templates to include latest WPKG features.
     Fixes bug 238. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.
NEW: When doing file date equal comparison to a date entered in ISO8601 format
     then milliseconds are ignored. So the comparison resolution is limited to
     1 second intervals.
     WPKG still applies full millisecond resolution when comparing to reference
     files or when using the olderthan/newerthan operators.
     Fixes bug 237. Thanks to Stefan Pendl.
NEW: Added support for "host" checks in <check /> nodes. All additional host
     check attributes are supported. Some examples:
     <check type="host" condition="hostname" value="^hostname$" />
     <check type="host" condition="os" value="windows 7" />
     <check type="host" condition="architecture" value="x64" />
NEW: Enhanced host attributes check modification applied. Now all XML nodes
     which support enhanced host attribute checks also allow more complex
     "condition" checks.
     Conditions specify whether the given node is applied or simply ignored
     by WPKG. The checks supported are identical to the checks supported for
     package installation.
     Here are some examples...

     Conditional installation
     ------------------------
     <profile id="default">
     	<package id="pidgin" >
          <condition>
            <check type="uninstall" condition="exists" path="Pidgin" />
          </condition>
       </package />
     </profile>

     Apply a package only if it is already installed. For example this could
     be used if users are allowed to install software. In case Pidgin was
     already installed when WPKG is run, then the package is applied.
     Caution: Your checks have to match the old and the new version on future
     updates. If you forget to update the check for future versions then you
     might end up with a profile which "lost" this package after upgrade and
     therefore results in uninstall on subsequent runs.
     For example an application with an uninstall entry of "App 1.0" should
     be checked for "App.*" (regular expression) instead of checking the full
     "App 1.0" string. Since later versions are likely to be named "App 1.1"
     or similar the condition will not match it and therefore the package is
     removed from the profile.

     Advanced host check (new style)
     -------------------------------
     Conditions combined with the new "host" type checks introduced in this
     update allows you to specify host checks in more advanced way. One
     example:
     <package id="pidgin" revision="1">
       <install cmd='setup-32.exe ...'>
          <condition>
            <check type="host" condition="architecture" value="x86" />
          </condition>
       </install>
       <install cmd='setup-64.exe ...'>
          <condition>
            <check type="host" condition="architecture" value="x64" />
          </condition>
       </install>
     </package>

     This definition is identical to:
     <package id="pidgin" revision="1">
       <install cmd='setup-32.exe ...' architecture="x86" />
       <install cmd='setup-64.exe ...' architecture="x64" />
     </package>

     Sure the later one (old style) is much shorter but offers less flexibility
     in terms of logical condition chaining. Moreover future attributes might
     clash with future attributes.
     The following construct would be possible too:

     <package id="pidgin" revision="1">
       <install cmd='setup-64.exe ...'>
          <condition>
            <check type="logical" condition="or">
              <check type="host" condition="architecture" value="x64" />
              <check type="host" condition="os" value="windows 7" />
              <check type="logical" condition="and">
                <check type="uninstall" condition="exists" path="some-prog" />
                <check type="registry" condition="exists" path="HKLM\..." />
              </check>
            </check>
          </condition>
       </install>
     </package>

     This would execute "setup-64.exe" only if either the architecture is x64,
     the OS string matches "windows 7" or if "some-prog" is installed along
     with a registry key.

     NOTE: Currently both advanced host checks are supported, the old
     attribute-style and the new check-style using condition XML nodes.
     In future versions of WPKG the attributes might be dropped.

NEW: Commands can now be defined in a more well-grouped format:
     <package id='pidgin' name='Pidgin IM' revision='2.10.0'>
       <check type='uninstall' condition='exists' path='Pidgin' />
       <commands>
         <command type="install" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\..."' />
         <command type="remove" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\..."' />
         <command type="upgrade" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\..."' />
         <command type="downgrade" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\..."' />
       </commands>
     </package>

     It's also allowed to mix old and new style where old-style commands are
     installed first:

     <package id='pidgin' name='Pidgin IM' revision='2.10.0'>
       <check type='uninstall' condition='exists' path='Pidgin' />
       <install type="install" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\install1.cmd"' />
       <commands>
         <command type="install" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\install2.cmd"' />
         <command type="remove" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\..."' />
         <command type="upgrade" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\..."' />
         <command type="downgrade" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\..."' />
       </commands>
     </package>

     Here WPKG would first install "install1.cmd" and then "install2.cmd".
     This is still the case if the commands are re-ordered:

     <package id='pidgin' name='Pidgin IM' revision='2.10.0'>
       <check type='uninstall' condition='exists' path='Pidgin' />
       <commands>
         <command type="install" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\install2.cmd"' />
         <command type="remove" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\..."' />
         <command type="upgrade" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\..."' />
         <command type="downgrade" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\..."' />
       </commands>
       <install type="install" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\install1.cmd"' />
     </package>

     Here still "install1.cmd" is launched first and then "install2.cmd".

     This new style of commands also allows you to specify any artificial name
     for type and refer to it in includes.
     For example:

     <package id='pidgin' name='Pidgin IM' revision='2.10.0'>
       <commands>
         <command type="install" include='prepare' />
         <command type="install" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\install.cmd"' />
         <command type="install" include='cleanup' />

         <command type="remove" include='prepare' />
         <command type="remove" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\remove.cmd"' />
         <command type="remove" include='cleanup' />

         <command type="upgrade" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\upgrade.cmd"' />

         <command type="downgrade" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\downgrade.cmd"' />

         <command type="prepare" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\prepare1.cmd"' />
         <command type="prepare" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\prepare2.cmd"' />

         <command type="cleanup" cmd='"%SOFTWARE%\cleanup.cmd"' />
       </commands>
     </package>

     In this example WPKG would launch the following commands during
     installation;
     - prepare1.cmd
     - prepare2.cmd
     - install.cmd
     - cleanup.cmd
     During remove the following commands would be run:
     - prepare1.cmd
     - prepare2.cmd
     - remove.cmd
     - cleanup.cmd

     NOTE: WPKG will not run any of the "prepare" or "cleanup" commands
     automatically if not included by command types known to WPKG (install,
     remove, upgrade or downgrade at time of writing).

     This is supposed to implement as well a request by Peter Hoeg
     submitted in Bug 184.

FIX: Enhanced recursive variable evaluation. Variables can now be used within
     other variable definitions as long as they are specified in correct order.
     For example specifying the following shall work now:

     <variable name="ext_id" value="{e2fda1a4-762b-4020-b5ad-a41df1933103}" />
     <variable name="ext_dirname" value="lightning" />
     <variable name="instdir" value="%PROGRAMFILES%\Mozilla \
               Thunderbird\extensions\%ext_id%" />
     ...

     Note that the last variable included a variable which is defined within
     the package itself. Previously it was only allowed to include variables
     which were defined at a different level (host, profile...).

     Fixes bug 236. Thanks to Kalyniak Oleksandr.

FIX: Fixed XSD of packages. Command-nodes are included using the 'include'
     attribute.
     Thanks to Stefan Pendl for reporting.

Changes 2011-09-15, v1.2.1-RC19 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed bug in XSD. Packages do not have installdate/uninstalldate
     attributes. Instead this attribute is supported within a package-
     assignment in the profile only. Moved attribute from package to profile.
FIX: Fixed bug that quiet mode was always on by default (should default to off)
     and therefore debug messages were sent to event log.
     Thanks to Heiko Helmle for reporting.
NEW: Added file date comparison operations to checks. Basically you can compare
     - file creation date
     - file modification date
     - file access time
     You can compare the date to a date string passed in the value attribute or
     compare to an existing file.
     Basic syntax example:
     <check type='file'
     condition='datecreatenewerthan'
     path='%SystemDrive%\test.txt'
     value='@%SystemDrive%\test-comparison.txt' />

     Valid conditions are:
     - datemodifyequalto   (Modify date equal to)
     - datemodifynewerthan (Modify date newer than)
     - datemodifyolderthan (Modify date older than)
     - datecreateequalto   (Create date equal to)
     - datecreatenewerthan (Create date newer than)
     - datecreateolderthan (Create date older than)
     - dateaccessequalto   (Access date equal to)
     - dateaccessnewerthan (Access date newer than)
     - dateaccessolderthan (Access date older than)

     The 'value' attribute has to contain a string in the following format:

     Relative timestamp (in minutes):
     -100     Means the file timestamp is compared to the timestamp 100
              minutes ago.
     +50      Means the file timestamp is compared to the timestamp 50
              minutes in the future.

     Absolute timestamp in ISO 8601 format:
     "2007-11-23 22:00"            (22:00 local time)
     "2007-11-23T22:00"            (Both, "T" and space delimiter are allowed)
     "2007-11-23 22:00:00"         (specifies seconds which default to 0 above)
     "2007-11-23 22:00:00.000" (specifies milliseconds which default to 0)

     It is allowed to specify the timezone as well:
     "2007-11-23 22:00+01:00"      (22:00 CET)
     "2007-11-23 21:00Z"           (21:00 UTC/GMT = 22:00 CET)
     "2007-11-23 22:00+00:00"      (21:00 UTC/GMT = 22:00 CET)

     File-Comparison:
     Prefix your value with the '@' character in order to point to a file to
     which the timestamp of the file referred in path is compared.
     Examples:
     @%SystemRoot%\explorer.exe
     @c:\myfile.txt

     Special terms:
     last-week           Check afainst timestamp of exactly one week ago (7 days).
     last-month          Check afainst timestamp of exactly one month ago (30 days).
     last-year           Check afainst timestamp of exactly one year ago (365 days).
     yesterday           Check afainst timestamp of yesterday (24 hours ago).

     Some more examples:
     Check if file has been modified after 15th of September 2011 15:00:
       <check type='file'
         condition='datemodifywerthan'
         path='%SystemDrive%\test.txt'
         value='2011-09-15T15:00' />

     Check if file has been accessed within the last week:
       <check type='file'
         condition='dateaccessnewerthan'
         path='%SystemDrive%\test.txt'
         value='last-week' />

     Check if file is older than one day (24 hours):
       <check type='file'
         condition='datecreateolderthan'
         path='%SystemDrive%\test.txt'
         value='yesterday' />

     Check if file is older than 12 hours (720 minutes)
       <check type='file'
         condition='datecreateolderthan'
         path='%SystemDrive%\test.txt'
         value='-720' />

     Implements change requested in Bug 147.
     Thanks to Jason Oster.


Changes 2011-09-14, v1.2.1-RC18 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Implemented new options for the /query argument. It now supports the
     following options:
       a   Query all packages.
       x   List packages which are not installed but in package database.
       i   List all packages which are currently installed.
       I   List packages which are about to be installed during
           synchronization.
       u   List packages which are about to be upgraded during
           synchronization.
       d   List packages which are about to be downgraded during
           synchronization.
       r   List packages which are about to be removed during synchronization.
       m   List all modifications which would apply during synchronization
           (equal to Iudr)
       n   List packages which belong to the profile but are not modified
           during synchronization.

     The options can be combined. For example /query:du would print just
     packages which are about to be upgraded or downgraded during next
     synchronization.
     The "m" option is a shortcut for /query:Iudr. So if you want to get a
     full list of all changes which will happen during next synchronization
     just use /query:m.
     Another example:
     If you want to see the list of packages as it will be after the next
     synchronization just use /query:Iudn. This will list packages which are
     new (I), upgraded (u), downgraded (d) and the ones which are already
     applied and are not modified (n).
FIX: Fixed a couple of bugs in install function which only affected very rare
     cases.

Changes 2011-09-13, v1.2.1-RC17 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Allow command inclusion. Incluiding a complete set of commands is done
     as follows:
     <install include="remove" />
     This would include all <remove /> commands into the install command list.
     WPKG also supports mixing of inclusion and real commands. For example:

     <upgrade include="remove" />
     <upgrade cmd="%SOFTWARE%\system-preparation" />
     <upgrade include="install" />

     This example would first execute all defined <remove /> commands, then
     execute the "system-preparation" binary and after this execute all defined
     <install /> commands.

     WPKG includes a detection for recursive inclusions. For example:
     <install include="upgrade" />
     <upgrade include="install" />
     <upgrade cmd="%SOFTWARE%\some-binary" />

     THis will make WPKG complain about recursion. WPKG will just ignore the
     recursive inclusion of <install /> but sill execute "some-binary" during
     the install process.
     Check the logs for recursion errors (severity: error).

     This change is supposed to fix bug 184 (resp. enhancement request).
     Thanks to Stefan Pendl for suggesting.

     Fixes/implements enhancement request 188 as well. Thanks to Peter Hoeg.

FIX: Fixed typo in reading expandURL attribute from download nodes.
     Fixes Bug 202. Thanks to mback2k for reporting.

Changes 2011-09-10, v1.2.1-RC15 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Download nodes were not evaluated during package removal.
     During package install/upgrade/downgrade WPKG reads <download /> nodes
     from either the package or as a sub-node of the command-node. During
     package removal no download nodes have been taken into account even though
     it was documented to be supported.
     This has been fixed now.
     Fixes bug 193.

Changes 2011-09-09, v1.2.1-RC14 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Expansion of environment variables in download URLs added.
     This allows specification of URLs with variables like the following:
     <download
     url="http://host/%VERSION%/release-%version%.exe"
     target="release.exe"
     />
     Note: As URLs are used to contain some percentage characters (like "%20"
     for spaces) these might be expanded too if the URL matches an environment
     variable which is defined. For example downloading from an URL like
     url="http://host/softwareX%20release%20.exe" would try to expand the
     environment "20release" as well. It's very unlikely that this collides
     with an environment variable you have actually defined but keep it in mind
     when defining download URLs.
     If you really need to disable expansion because the URL collides with
     existing environment variables then use the expandURL="false" attribute:
     <download
     expandURL="false"
     url="http://host/softwareX%20release%20.exe"
     target="release.exe"
     />
FIX: Fixed a bug that timeout value did not have any effect on download nodes.

Changes 2011-09-06, v1.2.1-RC13 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Further improvement on log file handling. Now the log file is not even
     opened if there is nothing to log. So if WPKG does not have anything to do
     and log level is set to 0x07 or lower, then WPKG will not even create an
     empty log file. Previous releases did create an empty log file in this
     case.

Changes 2011-09-06, v1.2.1-RC12 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Added full extended host attribute matching for <profile/> nodes in
     host definitions and <depends/> nodes in profile definitions.
     Some examples...

     Assigning profiles depending on extended host attribute matching:
     <host name="...">
     	<profile id="default" os="windows xp" architecture="x86" />
     	<profile id="default-x64" os="windows xp" architecture="x64" />
     </host>

     Of course the following is still possible too:
     <host name="..." profile-id="default-x64" architecture="x64" />

     Adding dependencies based on host attributes:
     <profile id="default">
     	<depends profile-id="default-x64" architecture="x64" />
     </profile>

     As a result the following nodes cannow deal with extended host matching:
     In hosts.xml:
     <host name="..." proifile-id="..." os="..." ... />
     <profile id="..." os="..." ... />
     <variable name="..." value="..." os="..." ... />

     In profiles.xml:
     <variable name="..." value="..." os="..." ... />
     <package package-id="..." os="..." ... />
     <depends profile-id="..." os="..." ... />

     In packages.xml:
     <variable name="..." value="..." os="..." ... />
     <depends package-id="..." os="..." />
     <include package-id="..." os="..." />
     <chain package-id="..." os="..." />
     <download url="..." target="..." os="..." />
     <install cmd="..." os="..." />
     <upgrade cmd="..." os="..." />
     <downgrade cmd="..." os="..." />
     <remove cmd="..." os="..." />

     Thanks to Malte Starostik for providing input.

     Thanks to Grég B. for reporting.

Changes 2011-08-27, v1.2.1-RC9 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
MOD: Updated log file handling. Now there is no intermediate local log file
     created any more. Instead a log is kept in memory as long as the log file
     is not initialized. If anything goes wrong WPKG still tries to flush the
     logs at least to a log file in %TEMP%.
     This potentially increases efficiency and execution speed slightly.
MOD: Enhanced parsing of command-line parameters.
     Enhances efficiency and potentially increases startup speed.
MOD: Added possibility to add true/false qualifiers to explicitly enable or
     disable a value on command line. As requested in bug 234.
     For example the following parameters are now supported:
     /quiet           Enables quiet mode.
     /quiet:true      Same as above. Enables quiet mode.
     /quiet:false     Explicitly disables quiet mode.
     /nonotify        Disable user notification.
     /nonotify:true   Same as above. Disables user notifications.
     /nonotify:false  Explicitly re-enable user notifications.
     ...
     Check 'cscript wpkg.js /help' for details.
     Thanks to Ben Hay for reporting.
NEW: Added new advanced host matching attribute "lcidOS" which matches against
     the executing host InstallLanguage attribute found at
     HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\Language.
     The use is identical to all other advanced host matching attributes.
     e.g.
     <install cmd="..." os="..." lcidOS="409" />
     <upgrade cmd="..." os="..." lcidOS="409" />
     Implemented as requested by Stefan Pendl and "grigribou".

Changes 2011-08-19, v1.2.1-RC8 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: XML files read from directories (e.g. hosts/*.xml, profiles/*.xml or
     packages/*.xml) have not been explcitly sorted. So the order of reading
     was depending on the OS and not strictly defined.
     Now all files are added to an array which is sorted in literal (ASCII)
     order. Keep in mind if you number your files that sort oder is literally
     and not numerically. So if you name your files "1.xml, 2,xml, 3.xml,
     10.xml, 11.xml, 20.xml" then the sort order will be:
     - 1.xml
     - 10.xml
     - 11.xml
     - 2.xml
     - 20.xml
     - 3.xml
     To prevent this try keeping the same amount of digits:
     - 01.xml
     - 02.xml
     - 03.xml
     - 10.xml
     - 11.xml
     - 20.xml
     Thanks to Donny Brooks who seems to have noticed first that the ordering
     somehow goes wrong for him.

Changes 2011-08-02, v1.2.1-RC7 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Added extended host attribute matching support for the following package
     notes:
       <depends />
       <include />
       <chain />
       <download />

     As a result the following nodes cannow deal with extended host matching:
     In hosts.xml:
     <host name="..." proifile-id="..." os="..." ... />
     <variable name="..." value="..." os="..." ... />

     In profiles.xml:
     <variable name="..." value="..." os="..." ... />
     <package package-id="..." os="..." ... />

     In packages.xml:
     <variable name="..." value="..." os="..." ... />
     <depends package-id="..." os="..." />
     <include package-id="..." os="..." />
     <chain package-id="..." os="..." />
     <download url="..." target="..." os="..." />
     <install cmd="..." os="..." />
     <upgrade cmd="..." os="..." />
     <downgrade cmd="..." os="..." />
     <remove cmd="..." os="..." />

FIX: Fixed start notification text in English LCID specification in config.xml:
     From: ...Plase safe all...
     To: ... Please save all...
     Thanks for Jeff Applegate for pointing this out.
FIX: Fixed long execution run times if many short-running external commands are
     invoked. For example if many execute-style checks were invoked and each
     check finished its task in less than 1s time, then WPKG would wait at
     least 1 second for it to finish. Unfortunately WSH is not very advanced in
     handling child processes but the algorithm has been changed in a way that
     for the first 100ms of run time the child status is checked every 10ms.
     For the next 1000ms the status is checked every 100ms. If the task is not
     finished by then the task will be checked for termination once per second.
     This allows short-running tasks to terminate quickly while preventing high
     WPKG load for monitoring on long-lasting tasks.

NEW: Added extended host matching for <check /> nodes. This enables to specify
     checks like:
     <check type="uninstall"
            condition="exists"
            path="Mozilla Firefox 5.0.1 (x86 en-US)"
            architecture="x86"
     />
     <check type="uninstall"
            condition="exists"
            path="Mozilla Firefox 5.0.1 (x64 en-US)"
            architecture="x64"
     />

     So you can specify individual checks based on specific host matches like
     the host architecture, OS or other attributes.
     Thanks to "cleitet" for suggestion. Fixes bug 205.

Changes 2011-07-20, v1.2.1-RC5 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed reading multiple XML files from directory. The last commit included
     too many optimizations and did not take into account that MSXML creates a
     new XML document when loadXML() is used on a XML DOM object instead of
     just modifying the existing one. So the root element has to be re-read.

Changes 2011-07-20, v1.2.1-RC4 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed reading of XML files. Specifically reading the root node including
     attributes. The change also includes simplified XML handling. The XML
     root node name is now read from the first XML file in the list (either
     the file passed as argument or from the first file read from the XML
     directory). Therefore the XML root node name parameter is not needed any
     more. The change also eliminates the requirement for XSL transformation
     in case only a single file is loaded. This might speed up single-file
     reading.

Changes 2011-07-20, v1.2.1-RC3 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Potential fix for changed XML parsing where XML database file is included
     to the XML tree before files in sub-directory. For example host.xml was
     read before hosts/*.xml files. Therefore if hosts.xml did include a
     "catch-all" entry (e.g. name=".*") it was always taken into account first
     no matter if there is a more-specifc match in any hosts/*.xml files.
     Now WPKG first parses hosts/*.xml files (in literal order) and then reads
     hosts.xml. Thus if there is a concrete match within any hosts/*.xml file
     this match takes precedence.
     Note that this change does not have any effect if applyMultiple is not
     enabled. If applyMultiple is enabled then anyway all host matches are
     evaluated.
     Thanks for Marco Gaiarin for initiating the discussion.

Changes 2011-07-19, v1.2.1-RC2 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed minor typo and formatting. One bug regarding code typo is likely
     never going to be executed in production. So no real impact on live
     systems expected.

Changes 2011-07-16, v1.2.1-RC1 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed another issue that specifying a command which could not be executed
     (for example if the specified target did not exist) caused WPKG to report
     an error which could not be catched by exit code "any".
     Reverted behavior to pre-version-1.2. So WPKG in such cases returns exit
     code "-1" which can be catched by an exit code "-1" or "any" statement.
     Fixes bug 226. Thanks to Bruno Choquet for reporting.
